# The Main Folder for the Game, should include a single Unity Project that is updated by each of us.
## File Conflict Prevention:
### Always make sure to Pull files before working on the Project on your side if someone else has pushed to the repo.
### When you finalize any changes to the local Project on your computer, remember to save. Make sure someone else hasn't pushed, if they did, merge your files and then push it to this repo.
