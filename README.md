# GameJam-JARS - This Repo contains the main Unity Project Files For the Game, Dead-End Janitor
A Unity game where you are a zombie janitor who would rather clean floors than eat brains! This project was initially a simple game submitted for the CSI/BC Winter 2025 Game Jam. 

# Notes
## Playable Executable Versions of the Game will be added under Releases.
## You can also check out our itch page [here](https://infnull.itch.io/deadend-janitor)!

## Game Controls: 
- Arrow keys to move
- Mouse to look around
- Press and hold mouse button to clean
- ALT to switch the cleaning tool. 
- SHIFT to toggle sprinting

### Note To Contributors:
I recommend getting Github's desktop app to make Tracking Changes and such simpler.
